    View - virtual table based on the result set of sql statement(kinda proxy to original db)
    Types of views:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Indexed - view that has been materialized.
            You index a view by creating a unique clustered index on it
            (clustered \approx sorted, only one per table can exist(thereby unique)).
        \item Partitioned - joins horizontally parti data from a set of member tables
        \item System - expos catalog metadata
    \end{itemize}

    index - kinda lookup table

    CREATE VIEW <view name>
    WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
    SELECT <cols>
    FROM <t>
    GO

    CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX <view name> -- or is it <index name>
    ON <view name>(<index key columns>)

    partitioned view:
    CREATE VIEW <view name>
    AS
            SELECT <cols>
            FROM <t1>
        UNION ALL
            SELECT <cols>
            FROM <t2>
        UNION ALL
            SELECT <cols>
            FROM <t3>

    Select db -> views -> System views

    <CREATE | ALTER> VIEW <v> AS
    SELECT <cols>
    FROM <t>
    WHERE <cond>;

    You can update underlying tables using view, but only one table at once, computed columns cant be updated(kinda obvious)

    UPDATE <v>
    SET <col = val>
    WHERE <cond>;

    INSERT INTO <view> (<cols>)
    VALUES (<vals>);

    Trigger - special procedure that executes in responce to certain action on table(e.g. insert delete update etc)
    DML triger types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AFTER - after the action (INSERT UPDATE MERGE or DELETE)
        \item INSTEAD OF - override the action
    \end{itemize}
    
    CREATE TRIGGER <trigger>
    ON <table>
    <AFTER | INSTEAD OF> <INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE>
    AS <transact sql statement>
    GO

    ALTER TRIGGER <trigger>
        ON <table>
        <AFTER | INSTEAD OF> <INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE>
    AS <statement>

    CREATE TRIGGER <tr>
    ON <DATABASE | ALL SERVER>
    <FOR | AFTER> <EVENT TYPE | EVENT GROUP>
    AS <statement>

    event types:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CREATE_VIEW
        \item ALTER_VIEW
        \item DROP_VIEW
        \item CREATE_TABLE
        \item DROP_DATABASE
        \item \dots
    \end{itemize}

    create trigger statement must be first in batch and can only apply to one table.
    a trigger is created only in current db.
    truncate table doesn't trigger delete trigger.
    instead of delete/update triggers cant be defined on tables with cascade foreign keys.

    Grouping & Ranking functions

    GROUP BY
    GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (<sets>)
    GROUP BY ROLLUP (<set>)
    GROUP BY CUBE (<set>)

    ROLLUP (1, 2, 3) is same as GROUPING SETS (
        1 
        1, 2
        1, 2, 3
    )

    CUBE (1, 2, 3) is same as GROUPING SETS (
        1
        2
        3
        1, 2
        1, 3
        2, 3
        1, 2, 3
    )
